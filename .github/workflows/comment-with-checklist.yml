            ## Next steps

            - [ ] Please assign the issue to the team member and make sure to mark the issue ```👋  Todo / Ready```
            - [ ] Assignee (Team Member) will mark the issue as ```🚧  In Progress``` and perform the vetting taks on the tracker and HS as indicated on the handbook
            - [ ] Once the vetting is completed mark the issue as ```✅ Complete```

            ## Public vs Private

            - Use comments for questions about the process and changes or to indicate delays, holding situation.
            - Avoid discussing the community or the organiser in comments on Github. Even if there are doubts about some applications.
            - We do not post vetting notes publicly and ensure such notes are strictly in the tracker or HelpScout.
